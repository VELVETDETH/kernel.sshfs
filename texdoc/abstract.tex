As the cloud services become more and more famous recently, and personal user level data clouds become cheaper, developing practical techniques which could build a "virtual environment" for those applications is quite necessary. With the help of Secure File Transfer Protocol(SFTP), and the easy to understand and augment Linux Virtual File System(VFS) API, it's possible to conquer that task. In this report, a brief introduction to the file system, which has been named as YaNFS will be listed first, and the implementation details and the \emph{communication protocal} between the \emph{kernel mode} and the \emph{user mode} will be illustrated next. Although this project is finished, there's still a chance to improve the performance. All the optimization techniques will be addressed in the end.
