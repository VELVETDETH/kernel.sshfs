Secure Shell(SSH) is one of the most useful tool for programmers: It could create a remote shell for you to operate on a remote machine, at the same time, the communication is quite secure. Secure File Transfer Protocol(SFTP) is a secure version of FTP, which you could do file operations through the SSH session. SSH session will be created once you've logged on your remote machine.

LibSSH could help you do a lot of tasks based on SSH and SFTP, and our application is built on that library. It's mechanism is quite simple: After you've created a SSH session by doing the authetication and specifying the host and port, you could call any kind of remote operations afterwards.
